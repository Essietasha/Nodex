//CREATE A REACT APP
  //Install node.js.......cmd(system) enter 'npm install -g create-react-app' ... Create a folder, drag and drop the folder 'myapp' folder into Vscode. Open a new terminal, run ' npx create-react-app my-app' Follow prompt....... enter. Now, run 'npm start'
  //React Manual https://www.codecademy.com/courses/react-101/articles/how-to-create-a-react-app
  //https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/install-react

//CREATE REACT using VITE
  //Create a project folder. Drag into VSCode. Open terminal. Run 'npm create vite@latest react-app' ...Follow prompt by selecting 'React' as framework and 'Javascript' as variant....Now, Run 'cd react-app', 'npm install'. 'npm run dev'.
  //Change port in vite.config file by adding  server: {port: 3000,}

//Install Tailwind: (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) Run on a different terminal-bash and NOTE change directory into the actual poject first ..cd project-name

//Install React icons: on the bash terminal... Run 'npm i react-icons' (https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
import { FaMapMarker } from 'react-icons/fa';
<FaMapMarker className='inline-mb mr1'/>

//ROUTER Package - to have multiple pages
//Install React Router : on the bash terminal... Run 'npm i react-router-dom'

//Install React Spinners : (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners)  (https://www.davidhu.io/react-spinners/) (https://github.com/davidhu2000/react-spinners) React Spinner: a package thst allow display spinner. Run 'npm i react-spinners'

//NPM: Node package manager (npm) is a package manager and a software register but it's also a place where developers can find, build and manage code packages.
//It's a library and registry for JavaScript software packages. npm also has command-line tools to help you install the different packages and manage their dependencies. 

//REACT TOASTIFY for Notification:2:46:12 (cd) npm i react-toastify
//Set Up: In the Layout Component, import ToastContainer from react-toastidy. Also import the css file: (import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css') Then put the <ToastContainer anywhere within the container/>return./>
//To use this in any componnet, simply import { toast } from 'react-toastify'; and call it using toast.success e.g toast.success('Job Deleted Successfully');

//Ctrl + c to stop running the React app in your command line.

//RUN AN EXISTING REACT FOLDER
//Note: DO NOT RUN 'npm create vite or npm install' except a new user who hasn't used react before or a third party openinig a zipped react file!
//Thus, to run an existing react folder. Open folder in VSCode.  Same day && Go to terminal, Run npm run dev. New day && Run 'cd react-app' 'npm run dev'.

//What are IDEs? An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently.

//INSTALL JSON SERVER: (on bash terminal, rem to cd into the project directory) install json server: Run 'npm install json-server' (or as dev dependency 'npm i -D json-server'). And inside the package.json file, within script, beneath preview, add ... "server": "json-server --watch src/jobs.json --port 8000" .
//A libray that lets you create a mock API and you can send get post put patch delete request so you can create CRUD 'Create, Read, Update, Delete' functionality. All you have to do is create a json file and you can put any type of resource you want in it.
//Set LIMIT of backend data being fetched : 'http://localhost:8000/jobs?_limit=3' ... //RUN backend(json) SERVER: On terminal, cd into project directory... 'npm run server'

//CREATE PROXY: Mostly for project deployment..A proxy server is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that . To create a proxy, do that within the vite.confif file ... In the server object beneath the port, add :
// proxy: { '/api': { target: 'http://localhost:8000', changeOrigin: true, rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, ''),}}

//Set a Form's DEFAULT field value: add the default field value within the html tag to the state default value.

//MAKING REQUEST TO THE BACK-END; EDIT, DELETE, ADD, SUBMIT.. //The POST (Add/Send)//GET REQUESTS(retrieve data). //PUT REQUEST(EDIT) //DELETE REQUEST
//To get, post, put, delete data, Configure the request(fetch function) and set  the method.

//REACT TOASTIFY for Notification:2:46:12 (cd) npm i react-toastify
//Set Up: In the Layout Component, import ToastContainer from react-toastidy. Also import the css file: (import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css') Then use <ToastContainer anywhere within the container.
//To use this in any componnet, simply import { tosst } from 'react-toastify'; and call it using toast.success. error

//APPLICATION STRUCTURE:
  // index Html: is the single page since our applicatio is a single page application
  // The src folder is our react application
  // main.jsx file is the entry point

//DEPLOYEMENT:
  //Test Code: Manual and automated test.
  //Optimize Code: Lazy Loading - Only load a component when it's needed. 387
  //Build App: Run 'npm run build'. Creates a build folder in our react app file. Gives a pdctn ready bundle of code(minified code). The content of this build folder is what will be deployed to a server.
  //Deploy/Upload App to a server: a static site host(not a/its server side host) is needed for this; Firebase hosting for instance. (https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting)
  //Github Deployment: 
  //Create a Repo in GitHub
  //Ignore build folder and nodemudules in gitignore file
  //Vscode terminal: bash - cd project-folder.. Follow all command prop from git init, add ., status, commit -m "Mssg", bramch, remote add, push...
  //Vscode terminal: 'npm install gh-pages --save-dev'
  //Update package.json with this line above- "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/your-repository-name"
  //Update the scripts section by adding predeploy and deploy scripts:

//REACT ROUTING
//Single-Page Application Routing ||client-side roting (Multiple pages in single-page app)
//ADDING ADDITIONAL PAGES IN YOUR PROJECT: Note, that can't be achieved with just react. Being a library, react doesn't have a way to add seperate pages. Hence, we will use the React Router which is a seperarte package, so we need to install it.
//React Router Setup... On Terminal, run 'npm i react-router-dom' Enter. So, we'l put all the Routing stuff in the main App file, which is App.jsx.
//How to Create Routes so you can have multiple pages.
//Above the App.jsx, import the ffg at the top:
import {Route, createBrowserRouter, createRoutesFromElements, RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';
import HomePagee from './Pages/HomePagee';

const router = createBrowserRouter(createRoutesFromElements(
    <Route index element={<Homepagee/>} />)
  );

  const App = () => {
    return <RouterProvider router={router}/>;
  }; //   export default App
//Nested Routes: Layouts || Shared loader.

//PAGES: Create a seperate folder called 'Pages' for the pages.Within, create a HomePage.jsx file.  Although they are still componnets, but should not put them in the same folder as the regular UI component. Now, import Homepage within App.jsx and render it within the routeprovider. Now, import all needed components, use within the return st into the Hompage and it'll be displayed on the screen.
//index: Default route that should be loaded for a component |Homepage| if the parent route is active.
//LAYOUT: This is mostly used for Navbars and Footers i.e elements we always want to show on all pages. So, create a layout folder in the src folder. Note: you can have multiple layouts. To use layout, import it(MainLayout.jsx) into App.jsx //Now, create a Rarent Route to the rest of our routes i.e other routes where we want the navbar and footer to always display will be embedded in this parent route. Set the path as well. (Line 89 but extended below): So basically, any route put in there will use the layout.  
const myApp = () => {
  const router = createBrowserRouter(
    createRoutesFromElements(
      <Route path='/' element={<MainLayout />}>
        <Route index element={<HomePage />} />
        <Route path='/jobs' element={<JobsPage />} />
        <Route path='/events/:eventId' element={<EventDetailPage />} />
        <Route path='*' element={<NotFoundPage />} />
      </Route>
  )
  );
  return <RouterProvider router={router}/>;
}
export default myApp;
//Object Based Approach to Routes
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';
const miApp= () => {
  const router = createBrowserRouter([
    {path: '/', element: <HomePagee />},
    {path: '/products', element: <ProductsPage />}
  ]);
  return <RouterProvider router={router}/>;
}
export default miApp;
//Object Based Approach to Routes with Layout. |Error Element
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';
const miAp= () => {

        <Outlet/>
        <ToastContainer/>
        </>
      )
    };
    export default MainLayout;

//LINKS: React works a little bit different. We don't use the anchor ref <a tags, we use the Link to tabs. Now, the href or to element here should go to the path defined in the router.. in this case... href="/jobs" as defined in the App.jsx router.
  //Another reason we don't use the a tag is because it does a complete page refresh which the link tag will avoid, making things very fast. So, in the Navbar, import Link: And change all a tags to Link tags and change the href to to=.
  import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';
    //NAVLink: Works the same way with Link tag except that it adds a class to the active link. Now we can change all the link tags in the navbar to Navlink as well as the import name above. 
    //Active Link list a:hover, list a:active{color: red, text-decoration: underline;}
      //Using NavLink -  Works the same way with Link tag but that it adds a class to the active link.
      //Navlink Active end prop: Add this if you want the home(/) button to be inactive if you are on other links that starts with the similar /path. The end prop ensures the link is active only when the URL is exactly the same as the to path. Without it, the link could be active for other URLs that start with the same path /. With end: The link is active only on /. Without end: The link is active on /about, /contact, etc., because they all start with /.
      <>
      <Link to="/">Home</Link>
      <NavLink to="/" className={({ isActive }) => isActive ? 'bgred' : undefined } end> Home </NavLink>
      <NavLink to="/products" className={({ isActive }) => isActive ? 'bgred' : undefined }> Products </NavLink>
      </>
    //To manually add a classLink to an active link or button, create a function above the return st within desired component and set className of the Navlink within the return st to the function. Check Navbar.jsx for ref.
      const linkClas = ({ isActive }) => isActive ? 'bg-red' : 'bg-white';
      <NavLink className={ linkClas }/>;

  //Link: To navigate between route pages. We do not directly render pages component within other jsx file, rather use links to navigate to them.
  //ADDING LINKS FOR DYNAMIC ROUTES - Individual Item
  //Note: This link to must be in relation to some path defined in the app.jsx dynamic routes. W will go to the EventDetailPage if the link is set like this.
  <Route path='/events/:eventId' element={<EventDetailPage />} />

  //UseNavigate: 
    //Used after submission, to re-direct user to the job page, use useNavigate hook from raect-router-dom. To use this useNavigate, first initialize.. const navigate = useNavigate();
    //Then, simply return navigate and whr to re-direct to. e.g navigate('/jobs'); Or return navigate('/jobs');
    import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
    function submitForm(){
      const navigate = useNavigate()
      //......
      navigate('/jobs');
    }
  
//useParams Hook: is a tool in React that lets you get information or dynamic values from the URL. The URL here is the dynamic part of a route you define in your React app.
//Display different DATA FOR DIFFERENT ITEMS/PRODUCTS in SAME component; make the router path dynamic by adding a parameter(placeholder). To do this, in the path, a column and an identifier.
      <Route path="/user/:id" element={<UserProfile />} />
    //In the above example, the :id part is a dynamic parameter, meaning it can change. So, if the URL is: /user/5, the id will be 5 .../user/123, the id will be 123
    //To get the id of a data - use Params Hooks from react router dom. Import useParams... Then destructure (based on the set in your route path) from useParams.  useParams returnsa an object which contains the dynamic path segment defined in the route definition.
    //useParams usually work with the id details of the data or list items fetched. For example, in places where we are not geting the id directly nor through props. 
    import { Suspense, useParams } from 'react';
    const params = useParams();

//DATA LOADER and useDataLoader | Fetching with React router: Provides an extra property that can be added to route definitions - loader property - which wants a function as a value. This function will be triggered and executed by react router whenever one is about to visit its/the route, just before the route gets rendered. Can fetch and load data within this loader function.
//Data Loader: Enables rendering a component with fetched data, not fetching data after it has been rendered. Create a function within a file and then export and use it in other areas i.e as a global state and use in other componenets.
  //useDataLoader: To get access to the data returned by the loader function, i,port useLoaderData Hook to get access to the closest loader data. Call useLoaderData, save to a const variable. Thus const variable now provides the returned data value from the loader function. Can then use this const var as needed.
  //Can also use useLoaderData within other components within or on the same level (or below but higher level)as the page component directly without having to destructure. Simply call useLoader data, assign to var and use. Any browser feature can be ued in the loader function except hooks because the loader function is not a component.
    //NOTE: Where should loaderData be stored? Within the main page component where it's needed for itself and other components. There, below the main page component function, define/create the loaderDat function. Then, export it. Import it in the App.jsx next to the actual/main page in the import statemnets above, and set it as a value to the page route loader property.

//Writing JSX
//JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for javascript. 
const p1 = <p>Large Font</p>;
//If a JSX expression takes up more than one line, must wrap the multi-line JSX expression in parentheses. 
(
    <a href="https://www.example.com">
        <h1>
            Click Here!
        </h1>
    </a>
);

// Nested JSX expressions can be saved as variables, passed to functions and so on, just like non-nested JSX expressions can! Here’s an example of a nested JSX expression being saved as a variable:
const theExample = (
    <a href="https://www.example.com">
      <h1>
        Click Here!!!
      </h1>
    </a>
  );
//Rendering JSX
//To render a JSX expression means to make it appear on screen.

//React relies on two things to render: what content to render and where to place the content. It uses the document object which represents our web page. Stores the element in container.
// We use createRoot() from the react-dom/client library, which creates a React root from container and stores it in root. root can be used to render a JSX expression. This is the “where to place the content” part of React rendering.
// Lastly,uses the render() method of root to render the content passed in as an argument. Here we pass an <h1> element, which displays Hello world. This is the “what content to render” part of React rendering.

//class vs className
//In HTML, it’s common to use class as an attribute name. In JSX, you can’t use the word class! You have to use className instead. This is because JSX gets translated into JavaScript, and class is a reserved word in JavaScript.


//JavaScript In Your JSX In Your JavaScript: regular JavaScript, written inside of a JSX expression, written inside of a JavaScript file.
//Curly Braces in JSX: Any code in between the tags of a JSX element will be read as JSX, not as regular JavaScript! JSX doesn’t add numbers—it reads them as text, just like HTML. You can do this by wrapping your code in curly braces.
(<h1>{2 + 3}</h1>)

//Variables in JSX
//When you inject JavaScript into JSX, that JavaScript is part of the same environment as the rest of the JavaScript in your file. That means that you can access variables while inside of a JSX expression, even if those variables were declared outside of the JSX code block.
const name = 'Gerdo';
// Access your variable inside of a JSX expression:
const greeting = <p>Hello, {name}!</p>;
  
//Variable Attributes in JSX
//When writing JSX, it’s common to use variables to set attributes.

const sideLength = "200px";

const pandda = (
  <img 
    src="images/panda.jpg" 
    alt="panda" 
    height={sideLength} 
    width={sideLength}/>
);
//Object properties are also often used to set attributes:
const pics = {
  panda: "http://bit.ly/1Tqltv5"
}; 

const panda = (
  <img 
    src={pics.panda} 
    alt="Lazy Panda" />
);



// STYLING REACT APPS {CSS}:   // - Static and Dynamic(Conditional) Styling

//1. Styling with Vanilla - Css files; CONS: Styles are not scoped to specific component. Solution: Inline Styling
//2. Inline styling CSS - uses curly braces
<> <p style={{
    color: 'red'}}>
  </p>

  <h2 style={{backgroundColor: isSelected ? 'green' : 'gray' }}>Hello React Developer</h2>
</>

//3. Adding a className Conditionally, ternary approach and always define an else st using undefined if you don't have one:
</> 
<>
<p className={ isActive && 'bg-red'  }/>
<p className={ isActive => isActive ? 'bg-red' : undefined }/>
<p className={`p-6 ${isActive ? 'bg-red' : ''}`}/>
</>

//4. Scoping styles with CSS Modules: Allows one to write vanilla css styles which are scoped to component files, making classNames unique per file for component files and component. i.e classes will be transformed by build process and unique classes will be provided. CSS module is not a default feature, rather it has to be implemented.
//Name Files: [Header.module.css] as components
//Importing: [import classes from './Header.module.css]
  </> <p className={classes.bigParagrapgh}></p>
  </> <p className={`p-6 ${classes.bigParagrapgh}`}></p>
  </> <p className={isActive ? classes.bigParagrapgh : 'bg'}></p>

//5. CSS-in-JS styling with 'styled components' package
  //Install: In terminal: 'npm install styled-components'
  //Import: iomport { styled } from 'styled-components';
  styled.input`
  display: flex;
  gap: 1.5rem;
  `;
//Now you can assign this to a variable and create as a component to use it.
//Accepts props in a unique way Plus Conditionals; set props in the created styled component, now accept prop in the style definition tag and set it conditionally and dynamically using a function.
//Using/prefixing the Dollar sign to props - so they don't clash with built-in props.
//Handling Children tags styles: Ampersand & and white space. To include other classes to a parent tag e.g div, header, p or any other tag
//Handling media queries with styled components: Ampersand &
//Psuedo-selectors with styled components
  const ControlDiv =  styled.div`
  display: flex;
  gap: 1.5rem;
  margin: 2rem;
  color: ${({$invalid}) => $invalid ? '#fffeee' : 'ffffff' };

  &:hover{
    color: grey;
  };

  & img {
    object-fit: contain;
    width: 8rem;
  }

  & h1 {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    font-family: 'Pacifico', cursive;
  }

  @media (min-width: 768px) {
    & {
      margin-bottom: 1rem;
    }

    & h1 {
      font-size: 2.25rem;
    }
  }

//INTERACTING WITH THE DOM IN REACT   //Event Listener and Event Handlers in a Component:
//In react, add event listeners to elements by adding special attribute to those elements; also called special props. E.g onClick={handleClick or clickHandler} The value provided within these curly braces should be a function; defined inside the component function.
//JSX elements can have event listeners, just like HTML elements can. You create an event listener by giving a JSX element a special attribute. Here’s an example:
//An event listener attribute’s value should be a function and it would only work if the function is a valid function that had been defined elsewhere.
function clickAlert() {
    alert('You clicked this image!');
} 
<img onClick={clickAlert} /> 
//Note that in HTML, event listener names are written in all lowercase, such as onclick or onmouseover. In JSX, event listener names are written in camelCase, such as onClick or onMouseOver.

//Function components can include event handlers. With event handlers, we can run some code in response to interactions with the interface, such as clicking.
function MyComponent(){
  function handleHover() {
    alert('Stop it.  Stop hovering.');
  }
  return <div onHover={handleHover}></div>;
}//In the above example, the event handler is handleHover(). It is passed as a prop to the JSX element <div>. Understand that props are information passed to a JSX tag.
//Event handler functions are defined inside the function component and, by convention, start with the word “handle” followed by the type of event it is handling.
//The handleHover() function is passed without the parentheses we would typically see when calling a function. This is because passing it as handleHover indicates it should only be called once the event has happened. Passing it as handleHover() would trigger the function immediately, so be careful!



//JSX Conditionals: If Statements That Don't Work: Here’s a rule that you need to know: you can not inject an if statement into a JSX expression.
//This code will not work
                    // (    <h1>
                    //       {if (purchase.complete) {
                    //           'Thank you for placing an order!'
                    //         } }
                    //     </h1>)

//How can you write a conditional if you can’t inject an if statement into JSX?
//One option is to write an if statement and not inject it into JSX. It will work if the words if and else are not injected in between JSX tags. The if statement is on the outside, and no JavaScript injection is necessary.

    img = <img src={pics.kitty} />
  } else{
    img = <img src={pics.doggy} />
  }    
  
//JSX Conditionals: The Ternary Operator. The ternary operator is a simplified conditional operator like if / else . Syntax: condition ? <expression if true> : <expression if false>.
//Recall how it works: you write x ? y : z, where x, y, and z are all JavaScript expressions. When your code is executed, x is evaluated as either “truthy” or “falsy”. If x is truthy, then the entire ternary operator returns y. If x is falsy, then the entire ternary operator returns z.
//Here’s how you might use the ternary operator in a JSX expression:
const headline = (
    <h1>
      { age >= drinkingAge? 'Buy Drink' : 'Do Teen Stuff' };
      {loggedIn ? <h1>Hello Member</h1> : <h2>Hello Guest</h2>};
      { loggedIn && <h1>Hello Member</h1>}
    </h1>
);

//Return Statement with conditionals - with this line of code, the code beneath(comp and jsx) will not be executed if this condition isn't met.
if(results.length === 0){
  return <p>Please eneter a valid number</p>
}


//The LOGICAL && Operator: The logical AND && operator for a set of boolean operands will be true if and only if both or all the operands/conditions are true . Otherwise it will be false .

//Mapping through an array and returning a JSX file; use () after the arrow function not {} / Creating a List Item

//.map in JSX: The .map() array method comes up often in React. It’s good to get in the habit of using it alongside JSX. If you want to create a list of JSX elements, then using .map() is often the most efficient way. It can look odd at first:
const containerr = document.getElementById('app');
const rroot = createRoot(containerr);
const mystrings = ['Home', 'Shop', 'About Me'];
const listItems = mystrings.map(eachstring => <li>{eachstring}</li>);
<ul>{listItems}</ul>

rroot.render(<ul>{listItems}</ul>);


//KEYS: When you make a list in JSX, sometimes your list will need to include something called keys. A key is a JSX attribute. The attribute’s name is key. The attribute’s value should be something unique, similar to an id attribute.
//keys don’t do anything visible! React uses them internally to keep track of lists. If you don’t use keys when you’re supposed to, React might accidentally scramble your list items into the wrong order.
//Not all lists need to have keys. A list needs keys if either of the following is true:
//A. The list items have memory from one render to the next. For instance, when a to-do list renders, each item must “remember” whether it was checked off. The items shouldn’t get amnesia when they render.
//B. A list’s order might be shuffled. For instance, a list of search results might be shuffled from one render to the next. If neither of these conditions is true, then you don’t have to worry about keys. If you aren’t sure, then it never hurts to use them!
<ul>
  <li key="li-01">Example1</li>
  <li key="li-02">Example2</li>
  <li key="li-03">Example3</li>
</ul >


//React Components: React applications are made of components.
//What’s a component? A component is a small, reusable chunk of code that is responsible for one job. That job is often to render some HTML and re-render it whenever some data changes.
//It’s useful to think of components as smaller pieces of our interface. Combined, they are the building blocks that make up a React application. In a website, we can create a component for the search bar, another component for the navigation bar, and another component for the dashboard content itself.
//Components in React are great because they are reusable. We can keep our component pieces separated, organized, and reusable by putting them into separate files and exporting them to where we need them.
  function MyComponent() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
ReactDOM.createRoot(
document.getElementById('app')
).render(<MyComponent />); 
//Function Component: Using JavaScript functions to define a new React component. In the past, React components were defined using Javascript classes. But since the introduction of Hooks, function components have become the standard in modern React applications.
//After we define our functional component, we can use it to create as many instances of that component as we want.
function MyComponent() {
  return <h1>Hello, I'm a functional React Component!</h1>;
}  


//Importing and Exporting React Components: A React application typically has two core files: App.js and index.js. App.js file is the top level of your application, and index.js is the entry point.
//Using and Rendering a Component
//We can use it with an HTML-like syntax that resembles a self-closing tag: //If you need to nest other components in between, you may also use an opening and corresponding closing tag structure:       
<><MyComponent />   
      <MyComponent>
        <OtherComponent />
      </MyComponent>
      </>
//However, to render our component to the browser, we must rely on the .createRoot() and .render() methods from the react-dom library. This should be done in our entry point, index.js. First, we call the createRoot method to create a React root container for displaying content. React applications typically have a single root DOM node, and everything inside it is managed by React DOM.
//Breaking it down a bit further: document.getElementById('app') returns a DOM element from index.html. .createRoot() receives the DOM element as the first argument and creates a root for it. .createRoot() returns a reference to the root container on which you can call methods like .render(). After the root is created, all that’s left to do is call the .render() method on the returned root and display the React component like so:
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('app')).render(<MyComponent />);


//Use a Variable Attribute in a Component
import React, { useImperativeHandle } from 'react';

const redPanda = {
  src: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b2/Endangered_Red_Panda.jpg',
  alt: 'Red Panda',
  width:  '200px'
};

function RedPanda(){
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Cute Red Panda</h1>
        <img 
          src={redPanda.src}
          alt={redPanda.alt}
          width={redPanda.width} />
      </div>
    );
}  


//COMPONENTS RENDER OTHER COMPONENTS
//Components Interact: A React application can contain dozens, or even hundreds, of components. Each component might be small and relatively unremarkable on its own. When combined, however, they can form enormous, fantastically complex ecosystems of information.

//Returning Another Component: As we’ve seen before, each React component is responsible for one piece of the interface. As the application grows in complexity, components need to be able to interact with each other to support the features needed. So far, we’ve explored components that return JSX elements, such as:
        //We can have components interact with each other by passing information or even returning other components i.e
function PurchaseButton() {
  return <button onClick={()=>{alert("Purchase Complete")}}>Purchase</button>
}
function ItemBox() {
  return (

//PROPS
//We use props in React to pass data from one component to another (from a parent component to a child component(s)).
//Informations that gets passed from one component to another is known as props. Props is a special keyword in React that stands for properties and is used for passing data from one component to another. Data with props are passed in a unidirectional flow from parent to child.    //AND, PROPS can be used in the child component alone without having to use it in the parent component.
//Props in React travel in a one-way direction, from the top to bottom, parent to child. Props passed down are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed. If a component wants new values for its props, it needs to rely on the parent component to pass it new ones.

//PARENT/CHILD: In React, when passing props, the parent component is the one that provides or "passes" the props, and the child component is the one that receives or "consumes" the props.
  //Parent Component: This is the component that owns or contains another component. It passes data to the child component through props.
  // Child Component: This is the component that is nested inside the parent component and receives the data via props.
  //Setting Props on Parent Component - Accepting and destructuring these props in Child Component.
    //To collect or spread other props: {...props}
//How to set DEFAULT values for props
function LoginPage({name, age}) {
  return <h1>My name is {name}</h1> ;
}
LoginPage.defaultProps = {
  name: "Designer",
  age: "Sixteen"
}
    
//Access a Component's props: Every component has something called props. A component’s props is an object. It holds information about that component. E.g type, value of a button element. To access a component’s props object, you can reference the props object and the dot notation for its properties. E.g props.name
//Pass props to a Component:  Pass information to a component’s props object by giving the component an attribute:
// To pass information that isn’t a string, then wrap that information in curly braces. Even arrays as seen below. 
<>
<Greeting name="Jamal" /> </>
<SloganDisplay message="We're great!" /> </>
<Greeting myInfo={["Astronaut", "Narek", "43"]} /> </>
<Greeting name="The Queen Mary" city="Long Beach, California" age={56} haunted={true} />

  

//RENDER A COMPONENT'S PROPS:
//You will often want a component to display the information that you pass. The most common use of props is to pass information to a component from a different component. NOTE: To make sure that a function component can use the props object, define your function component with props as the parameter:
function Button(props) {
  return <button>{props.displayText}</button>;
}         //in the example, props is accepted as a parameter, and the object values are accessed with the dot notation accessors pattern (object.propertyName).

//Object Destructuring: Alternatively, since props is an object, you can also use destructuring syntax like so:
function Button({displayText}) {
  return <button>{displayText}</button>;
}

//Smart Watch App - Product.js
//Object destructuring: function Product({price, rating, image}) {}
  function Product(props) {
    return (
      <div>
        <li>
          <img src={props.image} alt="" />
          <h3>{props.price}</h3>
          <p>{props.rating}</p>
        </li>
        <h1>{props.name}</h1>
        <h2>{props.price}</h2>
        <h3>{props.rating}</h3>
      </div>       
    );
  }

//PROPS.children Children props contains whichever contents between a component opening and closing tags
//Every component’s props object has a property named children. So far, all of the components that you’ve seen have been self-closing tags, e.g <MyFunctionComponent />. They don’t have to be! You could write <MyFunctionComponent></MyFunctionComponent>, and it would still work props.children will return everything in between a component’s opening and closing JSX tags. E.g <MyFunctionComponent> <MyFunctionComponent/> By using props.children, we can separate the outer component, MyFunctionComponent in this case, from the content, which makes it flexible and reusable.  
//If a component has more than one child between its JSX tags, then props.children will return those children in an array. However, if a component has only one child, then props.children will return the single child, not wrapped in an array.

//React Hooks
//STATE:  State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application. The state is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component.   //State is like a little storage box. It holds information that can change over time.
            //The state object holds data in a component that is expected to change over time. It is created and maintained by the component itself, and when it changes, the component re-renders; rememeber componenets only render once intially. Update UI;
            //Two Types: Component State. App Level or Global State.
//HOOKS: are functions that let us manage the internal state of components and handle post-rendering side effects directly from our function components. Using Hooks, we can determine what we want to show the users by declaring how our user interface should look based on the state.
//Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features.
//Hooks are functions that let developers "hook into" the React state and lifecycle methods from a functional component.
//React offers a number of built-in Hooks. A few of these include useState(), useEffect(), useContext(), useReducer(), and useRef().

//useState is a special function in React that helps you create and manage that storage box. It gives you a place to store a value and a way to change that value.
//When we call the useState() function, it returns an array with two values:
                                                //1. The current state: The current value of this state.
                                                //2. The state setter: A function that we can use to update the value of this state.
//Steps:
//1. Import useState 
import React, { useState } from "react";

//2. Initialize State: Next, you create a storage box with useState. You give it an initial value (the value it starts with). This is like saying, "I have a counter, and it starts at 0."
      //const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
          //count - is the current value in your storage box.
          //setCount - is a function you can use to update the state i.e the initial value which is count.
          //useState(0) - tells React that count starts at 0.
//3. Using State: You can now use count to show the current value and setCount to update it.
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      return (
        <div>
            <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
            <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
                Click me
            </button>
        </div>
    );

//UPDATING useSTATE BASED ON PREVIOUS VALUE OF THE STATE - YOU should pass a FUNCTION to the state updating function instead of the new state value you want to have. Like below:
//1. This doesn't gets the immediate available state
setIsEditing(!isEditing);
//2. This also doesn't gets the immediate available state
setIsEditing(isEditing ? false : true);
//3. This gets the latest available state: i.e runs a function and set the state to opposite of what it was using the Previous state value
setIsEditing((editing) => !editing);
setIsEditing((prevState) => !prevState);


//useState in Array and Object: (Reference values) - Create a copy of the old state i.e a new object or new array and then change or update that copy.
function handleGameClick(eachRowIndex, colIndex){
  setGameBoard((prevGameBoard) => {
      const updatedBoard = [...prevGameBoard.map((updatedPreArray => [...updatedPreArray]))];

  }); };

//DERIVING STATE

//FETCHING DATA with useEffect
//The useEffect hook is used in React to perform side effects in function components. Side effects are operations that affect something outside the scope of the function, such as interacting with local storage, fetching data from an API, setting up a subscription, or manually changing the DOM  especially when these operations should only occur once or under specific conditions.
//When using useEffect, the items are fetched and set in state only once, when the component first mounts. Subsequent renders won't re-fetch the items, which is the desired behavior.
//The useEffect: Is used in performng side effects in components; fetching data from an API. It takes two arguments; a function and a dependency array. Learnt that this hook runs on every render; whenever there's a change in the dependency which can actually cause an unending loop, in that case, it's preferable to inlude the second argument which in most cases is an empty array.This makes the useeffect run only on the first render.

//To make sure that onReset gets triggered when the dialog is closed via the escape key, you should add the built-in onClose prop to the <dialog> element and bind it to the onReset prop value. Which reset itself must have been a function written to handle close.
<dialog ref={dialog} className="result-modal" onClose={onReset}></dialog>


//PORTALS - A react feature that enables creating or putting components(jsx code) in desired places. For example, placing a component (dialog - modal) directly inside the HTML body; i.e teleport the rendered code into a different place in the dDOM

//1. import { createPortal } from 'react-dom';
//2. Takes two arguments. a, Nest the component's jsx file inside create portal. B,(immediately after the jsx code) an HTML element onto which the code should be teleported or rendered and this HTML el should be existent in the HTML file.

// The line: items.filter((_, i) => i !== index):is used to create a new array (updatedItems) that excludes a specific item based on its position (index) in the original items array. This code removes an item from the items array at the specified index by filtering out that item, creating a new array (updatedItems) that doesn't include it.
//   items: This is the original array containing all the items.
//   .filter(...): The filter method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
//   (_, i) => i !== index:
//   _: The first parameter (usually item) represents the current element in the array. It's not used in this case, so it's replaced with an underscore (_) to indicate it's intentionally ignored.
//   i: The second parameter represents the index of the current element.
//   i !== index: The test checks if the current index (i) is not equal to the index of the item to be deleted. If true, the element is included in the new array.
//   updatedItems: This is the new array that contains all items from the original items array except the one at the specified index.


//REACT Context API & useReducer: Advanced State Management - 
//REACT Context API: Manage state shared across multiple components
//COMPONENT COMPOSITION: Prop Drilling Solution

//REACT's Context API: Manage state shared across multiple components: Refer to Shopping-cart-context App
//IDEA: Create a context value and then provide that value, wrap this context around multiple components of your app. Also, this context value can easily be connected to State.
//Steps:
//Create a (store) folder in src; data and state store for the entire application or for multiple components. Within it, create a (shopping-cart-context.jsx) file.
//import { createContext } and useState-if nid from 'react.
//Create a CounterContext constant and set it to createContext: const CartContext = createContext();
//Pass in the default/initial values to createContext: num, string, object or array...
//Create the CounterProvider component that'll take in children.
//Define your state and setState
//Return a CounterContext.Provider that'll take in the count and setCount as the values of the value prop
//Pass in children – it represents everything to be nested when the Context is consumed
//Export CounterContext and CounterProvider

//CONSUMING Context
//Import: In the App.jsx or RootLayout, import CartContextProvider(import { CartContextProvider } from '../store/CounterContext); and wrap all other components it.
//Now, inside the GrandChild component where the count state and setCount function are being used, import useContext and CounterContext from the counterContext file.
//Also, pull out the count state and setCount from the CounterContext: const { count, setCount } = useContext(CounterContext); and use as needed.

//1. BUTTON COUNTER:
import { createContext, useState } from "react";
const CountContext = createContext({
      count: 0,
      setCount: () => {}
  });
  
  const CountProvider = ({ children }) => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    const increment = () => {
        setCount(prevState => prevState + 1)
    }
      return (
          <CountProvider.Provider value={{ count, setCount, increment }}> 
          {children} 
          </CountProvider.Provider>
      )
  }
export { CountContext, CountProvider};

//2. In the ROOTLAYOUT, wrap all elements with CountProvider
import { CounterProvider } from '../store/CounterContext';
const RootLayout = () => {
  return (
    <>
    <MovieProvider>
        <MainNavigation />
        <Outlet />
    </MovieProvider>
    </>
  )
}
export default RootLayout;

//3.Within needed nested child componenr, useContext.
import { useContext } from 'react';
import { MovieContext } from '../store/MovieContext';
const MyCounter = () => {
  const { count, increment } = useContext( MovieContext ); 
  return (
    <div>
      <h3>My List {count}</h3>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increase Count</button>
      {/* <button onClick={() => {setCount(count + 1)}}>Increase Count</button> */}
    </div>
  )
}
export default MyCounter;

    export function CartContextProvider({ children }){
      return <CartContext.Provider>{children}</CartContext.Provider>
    }
    export default CartContext;
            
//STEP2
import { CartContex } from './store/shopping-cart-context.jsx';

    //Note that this cartCtx will be accessed(either by dot notation or destructuring) based on the value provided in the main CartContext component. E.g <p>{cartCtx.items.map}</p> OR  <p>{items.map}</p>
//LINK CONTEXTVALUE TO STATE: Can provide state as a value to the CartContext.Provider in the main comp, best if the state itself has the same data structure as the CartContext component's value.

//useReducer Hook: Manage complex State data
//The useReducer hook is a tool for managing complex state logic in functional components. It serves as an alternative to the useState hook, particularly when the state logic becomes more intricate and involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.
//The reducer is a pure function that takes two arguments,parameters: the current state and an action. It returns a new state based on the action.
//An action is an object that describes what happened; i.e it's the defined action object that tells the function how to update the state. It usually contains a type field and, optionally, some payload data that provides more details about the action. 
//The function signature is typically: And should be defined outside the component function so that this function is not recreated whenever the component function executes.

// Define the initial state
const initialState = { count: 0 };

// Define the reducer function
  function reducer(state, action) {
  // logic to update state based on action
  switch (action.type) {

    case 'reset':
      return initialState;
    default:

//REDUX - Library - An alternative to React Context - for the potential disadvantages of Context in bigger applications. Disadvantages like: Deeply nested jsx code of ContextProviders components or even an extremely large Context component that becomes difficult to manage. Performance issue inclusive. NOTE: we can use both in an application while redux will be for the app-level state mgt while context will be for multiple component state mgt.
//Redux - A state management system for cross-component or app-wide state.
//State Types: Local state - managing state within a single component; Cross-component state - state that affects multiple components; App-wide state - state that affects the entire application e.g user authentication.
//How does Redux work? - Having one central data(state) store. Components subscribe to the store to get the data they need. The store gets the reducer function as an input.
  //How do we change data in the store? Components should never directly manipulate store data. Instead, use Reducer Functions which is responsible for mutating/changing/updating the store data. Note: This is not a useReducer hook.
  //Reducer function: is responsible for mutating/changing/updating the store data. Receives two parameters The old/existing state and action that was dispatched. Must return a new state object. Must not send a side effect inside a reducer function.
  //Components trigger/dispatch actions which describes what to be done but don't do trigger this action directly. Action: A javascript object with a type/payload property which describes the kind of operation the reducer should perform. .dispatch - a method which dispatches an action.
  //Then, Redux forwards action to the Reducer Function and these opeartions are performed by the reducerF. Then, the reducer spits out a new state which will now replace the existing state in the central data store. Now, all subscribed components have access to this new state.

//INSTALL REDUX: npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
//Since redux is not react specific, install "npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux" package instaead of "npm install redux" to make connecting react applications to redux very simple.

// Store: Holds the entire state of your app.
// Reducer: Determines how the state changes based on actions.
// Action: Describes what to do (e.g., increment, decrement).
// Provider: Makes the Redux store available to all components.
// useSelector: Retrieves state from the Redux store.
// useDispatch: Dispatches an action to change the state.

//STEPS: createStore: Deprecated! A. Create a store folder in the src B. Create an index.js within the store folder.
//1. Configure the Store. {deprecated- import createStore.} Create reducer function with state and actions declared; in if statements-type objects. Create a const store variable that accepts the reducer function as input.
//2. Provide the Store to Your React Application: In the main.jsx file. Import the Provider component and wrap it around the App component; the highest level component. Then import store and provide it as a store value prop to the Provider component.
//3. Connect Components to Redux. Import useSelector hook - used to select a aprt of the state managed by the store. 
      //Pass a function to useSelector to determine which part of the state to extract from the store; makes it easy to get a slice/tiny piece of the overall state object. Now save this returned value in a const variable.   const counter = useSelector(state => state.counter); Can use this var now in jsx code. <p>{counter}</p>
//4. Dispatch actions or change state: Import the useDispatch hook which gives us a dispatch function to execute which we can then save in a const variable. This function will then dispatch an action - with a type property with the value being one of the identifiers we used in the reducer function in the store(within our created function nested to any desired element e.g button) against/from the redux store.
//5. Attaching payloads to actions: Extra property added to the action object. Add an action type in store which needs to carry extra data. The dispatch function in the component as well must carry an extra payload after the type property.

                              //NOTE: In Redux, NEVER mutate/change the existing state. Instead override it by returning a brand new state object where you copy any nested objects or arrays i.e state objects(e.g return {counter: state.counter + 1}) and create brand new values.

//Using CreateSlice
//STEPS: A. Create a store folder in the src B. Create an index.js within the store folder.
//1. Create a Redux Slice: import { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'; Call createSlice() and save in a const variable. createSlice() takes an object as an argument. Stores the slice of our global state(diff pieces of unrelated state);
      //Every slice needs a name-an identifier for the piece of state. Then, an initialState. Then reducers - which is also an objecr i.e a group of all the reucers that specific slice needs..then in the reducer object you can now add methods-which arelike functions e.g increment() {} These methods will then be called in our component.
          //Then each method receives the latest state and actions(payload or extra data) if needed. Now, within thus method e.g increment() {} allowed to mutate the state here with reduxtoolkit. With this, don't have to create a copy of the state manually all the time, instead just change the code that needs to be changed.
//2. Configure the Store. Which makes merging multiple reducers into one reducer easy. Now, can call configureStore which takes in an object. Where w then set reducer property within which we set an object with key value pairs with different reducer functions being the value pair for the defined reducer key(name). 
      //In gen, a map of reducers for the main reducer. However, if it's a single reducer, can put this in the configureStore reducer property directly without the neeed to create key value pairs of reducers.
//3. Provide the Store to Your React Application: In the main.jsx file. Import the Provider component and wrap it around the App component; the highest level component. Then import store and provide it as a store value prop to the Provider component.
//4. Connect Components to Redux. Import useSelector hook - used to select a aprt of the state managed by the store. 
      //Pass a function to useSelector to determine which part of the state to extract from the store; makes it easy to get a slice/tiny piece of the overall state object. Now save this returned value in a const variable.   const counter = useSelector(state => state.counter); Can use this var now in jsx code. <p>{counter}</p>
//5. Dispatch actions or change state: Can use the const variable above saved to our createSlice reducer function to access actions. E.g createSlice.actions Then save this to a named const variable and export it.
      //In components where needed, we can then import it and use it within the dispatch function. e,g counterAction.increment(); always pass parentheses to the called function. in cases where payload is needed, insert it into the parenetheses; could be a number, object or anything. To be able to use this in the index.js reducer, refer as payload. e.g state.counter + action.payload;
//6. Attaching payloads to actions: Extra property added to the action object. Add an action type in store which needs to carry extra data. The dispatch function in the component as well must carry an extra payload after the type property.
