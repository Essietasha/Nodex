            FEATURES:
            ATTRIBUTE: open: <dialog open>This is a dialog.</dialog> When present, this attribute indicates that the dialog is open and visible to the user
            METHODS: dialogBox.show(): Displays the dialog as a non-modal, meaning the user can still interact with the rest of the page.
                    .showModal(): Displays the dialog as a modal, meaning the user must interact with the dialog before they can return to the main page content.

        The FIELDSET element is used to group related elements in a form. The fieldset tag draws a box around the related elements. 
        You can now nest LABEL elements inside your fieldset element.
        As label elements are inline by default, they are all displayed side by side on the same line, making their text hard to read. 
        To make them appear on separate lines, add display: block to the label element.-->

<!-- 
          INLINE/BLOCK ELEMENTS
            A block-level element always starts on a new line and always takes up the full width available and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element. 
            E.g Div, P, hr, ul, ol, section, article ...
            Inline elements do not start on a new line. It only takes up as much width as necessary or needed. 
            E.g Label, Span, a, input, button, img ... -->
            <!-- If you want the input and label text to appear on the same line, start, by giving the input elements a class of inline. 
            Now, select only the .inline elements, and give them width of unset. This will remove the earlier rule which set all the input elements to width: 100%.
            Add some space between the .inline elements and the label text, by giving a right margin of 0.5em. Also, set all the other margin to 0.
            If you look close enough, you will notice the .inline elements are too high on the line. To combat this, set the vertical-align property to middle.-->


        <!-- You can select the last element of a specific type using the last-of-type CSS pseudo-class, like this: -->
            <!-- E.g 1 p:last-of-type { } -->
            <!-- E.g 2 fieldset:last-of-type{
                border-bottom: none;
              } 

            *****MARGIN 1em auto
            Auto means that the left/right margin are automatically set based on the container. If your element is a block type element, meaning it is a box and takes up the entire width of the view, then auto sets the left and right margin the same and hence the element is centered.
        
             *****em
             The size of an EM or percent depends on its parent. If the text size of body is 16 pixels, 
             Then 1em  em equals to the current font size
               2em will be double (X2) of the default font-size 32px


            *****rem
            rem stands for root em, which is a measurement unit that refers to the font-size of the root element of a document. 
            NOTE: It is a relative unit, which means all values that use it change when the root's font-size changes. The root element in this case refers to the html element. 
            1rem means 1 times the root font-size.
            *Basically both rem and em are scalable and relative units of size, but with em, the unit is relative to the font size of its parent element, while the rem unit is only relative to the root font size of the HTML document. The “r” in rem stands for “root”.

    background: linear-gradient();
    background: radial-gradient(); This will add circular gradient to your background.
                                    E.g   .sky{ background: radial-gradient(#ffcf33 0%, #ffcf33 20%, #ffff66 21%, #bbeeff 100%);}
                                    At the top of the sky gradient color list, where you would put a direction for the gradient; add circle closest-corner at 15% 15%,. This will move the start of the gradient to 15% from the top and left. It will make it end at the closest-corner and it will maintain a circle shape. These are some keywords built into gradients to describe how it behaves.
    background-position:            i.e .sky { background: radial-gradient( closest-corner circle at 15% 15%,
                                                    #ffcf33,

    transform:               - The transform property allows you to modify the shape, position, and size of an element without changing the layout or affecting the surrounding elements. It has functions such as translate(), rotate(), scale(), skew(), and matrix().
                                    transform: translate(5px, 8px); X and Y axis.    
                                    transform: translate(9px); X 9px and Y 0px axis.    
    transform: scale(0.8);   - This is a specific type of transformation that changes the size of the element. The value 0.8 means that the element will be scaled to 80% of its original size.
                                A value less than 1 (e.g., 0.8) makes the element smaller. A value greater than 1 (e.g., 1.2) makes the element larger. A value of 1 means no scaling, so the element retains its original size.
    transition: transform 0.2s ease-in-out 0.1s;   - This specifies that the transition should be applied to changes in the transform property.
                            The transition property(transition: transform 0.2s ease-in-out 0.1s;) is a shorthand for:
                            i.  transition-property
                            ii. transition-duration

                            iv. transition-delay
    transform: translateX(-50%): moves the element to the left by 50% of its own width.

                                        You can use an alpha channel to lower the opacity of the black border.

    vertical-align: top; To align texts vertically
    z-index: 100;       Z-index is a property you can use to define the order of overlapping HTML elements. Any element with a higher z-index will always be positioned over/above/ontop an element with a lower z-index. When u use - for z-index on an element, it means that element will be placed below other elements.
    TABLE BORDER
    border-collapse: collapse;  The Collapse property to collapse, which will allow cell borders to collapse into a single border, instead of a border around each cell.
    border: 0;

    //CSS ATTRIBUTE SELECTOR  The [attribute="value"] selector targets any element that has an attribute with a specific value.E.g
      input[type = "submit"]{
        display: block;
        width: 60%;
     }
     E.g 2
     tr[class="total"] {
        border-bottom: 4px double #0a0a23;
        font-weight: bold;}



    BLUR ELEMENT
        .youritemwithblurbackground {
            background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4);
            -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(5px);
            backdrop-filter: blur(5px);
            padding: 20px 30px;
            }

            .yourcontainer {
                background: url() no-repeat center;
                background-size: cover;
                width: 400px;
                }


    BOX-SHADOW
    The box-shadow property lets you apply one or more shadows around an element. Here is basic syntax:
        box-shadow: offsetX offsetY blurRadius spreadRadius color;
        Here's how the offsetX and offsetY values work:
        A positive offsetX value moves the shadow right and a negative value moves it left
        A positive offsetY value moves the shadow down and a negative value moves it up
        If you want a value of zero (0) for any or both offsetX and offsetY, you don't need to add a unit.
        Blurradius for a blurry edge to avoid sharp edges.
        Spreadradius to expand the shadow out further.
        box-shadow: 5px 5px red;
        box-shadow: -5px -5px red;
        box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px red; 
        box-shadow: 0px 0px 0px 5px red;
        box-shadow: 0px 0px 20px 0px red;
            box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgb(0, 0, 0, 0.5);

    overflow:hidden/visible; Sometimes to hide any scroll bars that appear when something extends past the viewport.
    opacity:
    a:
    a:hover;            .btn:hover:not(.showContent) {
                                            background: #e93b81;
                                            color: white;
                                        }
    a:active;
    a:visited;
    float:
    clear-both;
    cursor: pointer;
    button:hover {transition: 1s ease-out;
    transform: scale(0.8);}
    .inline{
        width:unset;
    }

    CSS POSITIONING: CSS positioning lets you set how you want an element to be positioned in the browser. Once you set the position property of the element, you can move the element around by setting a px or a percentage value for one or more of the top, right, left, or bottom properties.
    Static: Static is the default positioning for all elements. If you assign it to an element, you won't be able to move it around with top, right, left, or bottom. It's the default positioning of elements. Each element goes next/beyond the other.
    Relative: NOTE: Relative doesn't mean it's relative to anything else on screen. Item gets positioned relative to it's default position and makes it possible to apply some changes to its def p. When you use the relative value, the element is still positioned according to the normal flow of the document, but the top, left, bottom, and right values become active.
                 .chead: {position: relative;
                            top: 100px;
                            left: 100px;}
    Absolute:This makes the position relative to the NEAREST positioned ancestor(Move the div 10px left and 12px from the top from its ancestor begnn point). e.g a div inside another div. If it doesn't have an ancestor or no ancestor with a position property set, then the second rule becomes active where it gets pos rel to the top left corner of the webpage. When you use the 
    absolute value for your position property, the element is taken out of the normal flow of the document, and then its position is determined by the top, right, bottom, and left properties. Best to use a z-index to put an element backward when absolute positioning puts an object on top of another. (z-index:-1)
    Fixed: Positions an element relative to the top left corner of the browser window. Fixed is a position property value that lets you make an element fixed to the page no matter where the user scrolls to on the page.
    initial
    Inherit
    Sticky: Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. It allows an element to stick to a specific position within its containing element or viewport, based on the scroll position.
    Z-Index: Which item determines which item comes comes on top of the other.
    NOTE: z-index only applies to positioned elements

    FLEXBOX WIth GRID: To centre items inside a grid item, we can use the display flex and align property.

    CSS Cascading Style Sheets FLEXBOX* Main/Cross Axis
     display:flex;
     display:inline-flex; To make the content only occupy as much width as it needs to fit.

        flex: 2;
        flex: 0.5;

    ON FLEX ITEM
        order:  Order/arranges elements acc to their orders, the biggest order no is placed at the end of the flexbox. eg .box2 order:10...
        flex-basis:100px;

                    width: 100px;
                    max-width: Determines how much the item is allowed to grow to.
                    min-width:flex-basis: (to set the width of the item)

        align-self: 
        -->

        <!-- SPAN texts in a row/paragraph to the left and right side of the page.
        First, span both texts.
        Give it a Display property to Flex. Then, justify-content to space between, then Align items to Flex-end. 
    
        ROWS vs COLUMN: The key difference between columns and rows is that a column arranges data vertically from top to bottom, while a row arranges data horizontally from left to right.

<!-- CSS COLORS -->
    <!-- There are two main color models
    The Addictive RGB(Red, Green, Blue)
    The Subtractive CYMK(Cyan, Magneta, yellow, Black)
    Color Numbers ranges from (0-255)

    PRIMARY COLORS: Red, Green, Blue
    SECONDARY COLORS
        Red+Green = yellowGreen
        Blue = Cyan
        Blue+Red= Magneta
    TERTIARY COLORS: rgb(255, 127, 0) Orange

    WAYS TO APPLY COLORS IN CSS
    1. RGB: background-color: rgb(255, 0, 255, 0.3);
    //rgb(r, g, b): This function represents a color using the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color model.
        Each parameter (r, g, b) can have a value from 0 to 255.
        Example: rgb(255, 0, 0) represents pure red.
    //rgba(r, g, b, a): This function is similar to rgb(), but it includes an alpha (a) parameter. The alpha parameter represents the opacity of the color and can range from 0 (completely transparent) to 1 (completely opaque).
        // rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.3): This color function represents a white color (rgb(255, 255, 255)) with 30% opacity.
        
    2. Hexadecimal/Hex Values
    Hex color values start with a # character and take six characters from 0-9 and A-F. The first pair of characters represent red, the second pair represent green, and the third pair represent blue.
    With hex colors, 00 is 0% of that color, and FF is 100%. So #00FF00 translates to 0% red, 100% green, and 0% blue, and is the same as rgb(0, 255, 0).
    #00FF00;
    3. hsl (hue, saturation, lightness) hsl(243, 50%, 60%)
    4. Gradient
    A gradient is when one color transitions into another. The CSS linear-gradient function lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.
    :linear-gradient(gradientDirection, color1, color2,color3...)
    background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgb(255,0,0), rgb(0,255,0), rgb(0,0,255));
    To Add Color Stops:
    background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgb(255,0,0) 75%, rgb(0,255,0)5%, rgb(0,0,255)20%);
    OR
    background: linear-gradient(180deg, #55680D, #71F53E), #116C31;
    BEST
    background: linear-gradient(#55680D, #71F53E), #116C31;
    HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)
    background: linear-gradient(hsl(186, 76%, 16%), hsl(206, 66%, 20%), hsl(100, 70%, 24%));

    REPEATING-LINEAR-GRADIENT
    Repeating-linear-gradient will make the all colors of your gradient repeat until it gets to the bottom of the element; giving you some stripes, and saving you from having to add a bunch of elements to create them.
    E.g   background: repeating-linear-gradient( 
                        var(--building-color2),0%
                        var(--building-color2) 6%,
                        var(--window-color2) 6%,
                        var(--window-color2) 9%
                        ); Note: in this example, we used color variables.

CSS DISPLAY: 
    BLOCK: The default display property for div elements is BLOCK. So when two block elements are next to each other, they stack like actual blocks. For example, your marker elements are all stacked on top of each other.
    IN-LINE: To position two div elements on the same line, set their display properties to inline-block.
    IN-LINE BLOCK: Inline-block elements combine characteristics of both block and inline elements. They do not start on a new line like block elements, but they allow other elements to sit beside them on the same line, similar to inline elements.
    NONE -->
        


<!-- CSS PSEUDO SELECTORS 
    CSS pseudo-selectors (or pseudo-classes) are special keywords added to selectors that specify a special state of the selected elements. They are used to style elements based on their state, position, or relation to other elements, without needing to add classes or IDs directly to the HTML.
        * - The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page
        a:hover{ }
        input:focus{ }
        button:active{ }
        a:visited{ }
        li:nth-child(2){}
        p:nth-of-type(3){ }
        p:first-child{ }
        p:last-child{ }
        p:not(.highlight){ }
        h1:before { }
        h1:after{ }
        input:disabled{ }
        input:checked{ }
        p:first-of-type{ }
        p::first-letter { }
        p::first-line{ }
-->
            
<!-- 

    You can use CSS to make elements with this class completely hidden from the visual page, but still be announced by screen readers.
    The CSS clip property is used to define the visible portions of an element. The clip-path property determines the shape the clip property should take. 
    Now you need to size these elements down
    To prevent the text content from overflowing, give your span[class~="sr-only"] selector an overflow property set to hidden and a white-space property set to nowrap.
    Finally, you need to take these hidden elements out of the document flow. Give the span[class~="sr-only"] selector a position property set to absolute, a padding property set to 0, and a margin property set to -1px. This will ensure that not only are they no longer visible, but they are not even within the page view.


    The :not() pseudo-selector is used to target all elements that do not match the selector - in this case, any of your span elements that do not have the sr-only class.
    span:not(.sr-only){
    font-weight: normal;
    } i.e if your not in this class, let ur font weight be normal.

    ::before selector  - creates a pseudo-element which is the first child of the selected element. This will target the elements with the specified class or classes, and select the pseudo-element after these elements in the HTML. Also set the content property to "". This will make the pseudo-elements empty.
    ::after selector  - creates a pseudo-element which is the last child of the selected element. 


        (!important) keyword
    Rather than having to constantly double-check you are not overwriting your earlier properties, you can use the !important keyword to ensure these properties are always applied, regardless of order or specificity.
    Give each property in your span[class~="sr-only"] selector an !important keyword. Do not change any of the values. Now that you have added the !important keyword, you can remove the :not(.sr-only) from your span selector.


    The :nth-of-type() pseudo-selector is used to target specific elements based on their order among siblings of the same type.
        E.g target the third td element within your total table rows.
        tr.total td:nth-of-type(3){
        padding: 0.5rem;
        }

    The  :last-of-type{} selector is used to select the last type of an element 
    tr.data td:last-of-type{
    padding-right: 0.5rem;
    }
         
COMBINATORS: (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Combinators)
    1. Descendant Combinator
    2. Child Combinator
    CHILD SELECTOR: article > p  or select all direct childre .container > * { } ...
    DESCENDANT SELECTOR: article, p


        Use a DESCENDANT SELECTOR to target two,three, more or all (div) elements inside an(div) element. To select all, two or more divs in a div element at Once. E.g cat-mouth is a div holding two other divs.
        .cat-mouth div {
        width: 30px; etc} 


CSS VARIABLES
    Variable declarations begin with two dashes (--) and are given a name and a value like this: --variable-name: value; With CSS variables you can change values without searching everywhere in the stylesheet.
    E.g .divcont{
    --box1color:#fff;
        }            OR   --building-color1: #999;
    To use a/the variable, put the variable name in parentheses with var in front of them like this: var(--variable-name). Whatever value you gave the variable will be applied to whatever property you use it on.
    E.g .divcontainer{
            background-color: var(--building-color1);
            }
    NOTE:    Change the value of your variable from #999 to #aa80ff and you can see how it gets applied everywhere you used the variable. This is the main advantage of using variables, being able to quickly change many values in your stylesheet by just changing the value of a variable.
    NOTE: FALLBACK: ou should add a fallback value to a variable by putting it as the second value of where you use the variable like this: var(--variable-name, fallback-value). The property will use the fallback value when there's a problem with the variable. 
            However, to avoid problems with the variables, declare them in the :root selector. With this, you won't need a afallback value any longer.
                                E.g .divcontainer{
                background-color: var(--building-color1, green); Green is the fallback value.
                }
    NOTE:    :root selector     The BEST way to declare variables is to declare them in the :root selector. This is the highest level selector in CSS; putting your variables there will make them usable everywhere. 
                    Add the :root selector to the top of your stylesheet, and put all your variable declarations there.
                    E.g :root{--building-color1: #aa80ff;
                                --building-color2: #66cc99;
                                --building-color3: #cc6699;
                                }
                    Note that you can use color variables on linear gradient as well by using the background property and any where else in your code.
                    E.g background: linear-gradient(orange, var(--building-color1), var(--window-color1));
                                
    .box *{ Target ALL Descendants of an element.

            }
        
MEDIA QUERY
    The @media at-rule, also known as a media query, is used to conditionally define breakpoint stylings. Media queries are commonly used to apply CSS based on the viewport width using the max-width and min-width properties. E.g
    media (min-width: 600px) { i.e 600 screen and above
            
    media (max-width: 600px) { i.e 600 screen and below
            #piano {
                width: 358px;
            }

            .keys {
                width: 318px;
            }

            .logo {
                width: 150px;
            }
        } To avoid overflow of excess content, Set overflow to hidden. This property will hide any element that is pushed outside the set width value of the specified class or element or parent element.
                .keys{
                    overflow: hidden;
                }
            }
                    
                
    LOGICAL OPERATORS: Logical operators can be used to construct more complex media queries. The and logical operator is used to query two media conditions.
    For example, a media query that targets a display width between 500px and 1000px would be:
        @media (min-width: 500px) and (max-width: 1000px){
            Add rule here...
            }
            E.g      @media (max-width: 1199px) and (min-width: 769px) {
                            #piano{
                            width: 675px;
                            }
                            .keys{
                            width:633px
                            }

WEB HOSTING: Section 4, lesson 29. Making your website available anywhere on the internet. To do this, put the website, project/file and everything it consists of in a web server. This web server is actually connected to the internet. (Opposed to local development).
    On Git hub, create a repository. Click Add Files-Upload Files. Note: Do not drag and drop one/main folder, rather open the main folder, drag and drop all related folder/files within it. Add a Read me file. Navigate to setting. Navigate to Pages. Change the branch to main with the drop-down arrow. Click Save. Refresh page a couple of times. Now, you have your website URL… 
    NOTE: The dragged in files must contain an “index.html” file.

VIDEO TAG
    (https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_video.asp)
    
    HTML:    <div class="movieCont visibility">
            <video  controls class="vid" id="trailer">
                <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
            </video>
            <button class="close" onclick="closeMovie()">X</button>
        </div>
        
        CSS:video.play();
            video.pause();
            video.currentTime = 0;
        

Custom Data Attribute: (data-id="step1") Custom data attributes allow you to store extra information directly on HTML elements. These attributes are not part of the official HTML specification but are defined using the data- prefix, which makes them valid HTML5 attributes.
    The data- prefix indicates that this is a custom data attribute.
    In this case, data-id is the name of the attribute. The value of data-id in this example is "step1".
    Custom data attributes are used to embed custom data within HTML elements. This data can then be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript or CSS.

    Accessing Custom Data Attributes with JavaScript
        You can access the value of a custom data attribute using JavaScript, typically with the dataset property.
            // Select the element with data-id="step1"
            const step1Element = document.querySelector('[data-id="step1"]');

            // Access the custom data attribute value
            const stepId = step1Element.dataset.id;

            In this example: 
            document.querySelector('[data-id="step1"]') selects the HTML element with data-id="step1".
            step1Element.dataset.id accesses the value of the data-id attribute, which is "step1".

FONT AWESOME 4 (https://www.w3schools.com/icons/fontawesome_icons_intro.asp)
    Font Awesome: is a popular icon toolkit and library that provides a wide array of scalable vector icons that can be customized with CSS. It is widely used in web development to easily add icons to web pages, providing visual enhancements and improving the user interface.
    Usage: Using CDN:     
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0-beta3/css/all.min.css">

    Customizing Icons with CSS:        .fa-camera {
                                            color: red;
                                            font-size: 50px;
                                        }
    
    How to stop font awesome from overriding my custom CSS?
    1. Use More Specific Selectors:         .custom-container .custom-icon {
                                                    color: red; /* More specific selector */
                                                }
    2.  Use the !important Rule:         .custom-icon {
                                                color: blue !important; /* Custom color with higher priority */
                                                font-size: 40px !important; /* Custom size with higher priority */
                                            }     
    3. Load Your CSS After Font Awesome:     
                    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0-beta3/css/all.min.css">
                    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> (Your custom stylesheet here)
                    
                    
    Fixed Width Icons in fa: Just like letters and other characters, icons can have different widths, and if you need to vertically align icons like in a list or a menu, this can be a problem. The fa-fw class is used to set icons at a fixed width.
        <p>Fixed Width:</p>
        <div><i class="fas fa-arrows-alt-v fa-fw"></i> Icon 1</div>
        <div><i class="fas fa-band-aid fa-fw"></i> Icon 2</div>
        <div><i class="fab fa-bluetooth-b fa-fw"></i> Icon 3</div>

CSS ANIMATION: (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp)  (https://blog.hubspot.com/website/css-animation#types-of-css-animation)
    TYPES of CSS Animation: 
    Text Animation
    Color Animation
    Slide-In Animation
    Rotate Animation
    Wave Animation
    Glow Animation
    Bounce Animation
    Fade-in Animation
    Hover Animation
    Infinite Loading Animation
    Parallax Scrolling Animation


    {CSS Animation Properties:
    @keyframes
    animation-name
    animation-duration
    animation-delay
    animation-iteration-count
    animation-direction
    animation-timing-function
    animation-fill-mode
    animation-play-state}

    The FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENT OF CSS ANIMATION: @keyframes @rule;
    Keyframe CSS: CSS animations are made up of two parts: keyframes and animation properties.
                    Keyframes are used to specify how an animated element should appear throughout the animation cycle. At least one keyframe must be defined in a CSS animation, but it's most common to see at least two. Typically, they describe the start and end of the animation. Additional keyframes can be defined to describe any intermediate steps between the start and end of the animation cycle.
            @keyframes animation-name {
                <percentage > {
                    property: value;}
                <percentage > {
                    property: value;}
        
        Note that the @keyframes rule must have the same value as the animation-name property. This allows the browser to match an animation to its keyframes declaration.
        Keyframe selectors can use percentages to specify when they take place along the animation cycle. If they are specifying 0% (the start of the animation cycle) or 100% (the end of the animation cycle), then they can use the keywords from or to instead.
                
        USING ANIMATION:
        1. Bind the animation to an element.
            div {
                animation-name: slide-right, slide-in;
                animation-duration: 4s;                      (The animation-duration property defines how long an animation should take to complete.)
                animation-delay: 2s;                         (The animation-delay property specifies a delay for the start of an animation.)
                animation-iteration-count: 3;                (The animation-iteration-count property specifies the number of times an animation should run.)
                                        animation-iteration-count: infinite;   - Uses the value "infinite" to make the animation continue for ever.
                animation-direction: normal;                (Specifies whether an animation should be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles.):
                                        normal - The animation is played as normal (forwards). This is default
                                        reverse - The animation is played in reverse direction (backwards)
                                        alternate - The animation is played forwards first, then backwards
                                        alternate-reverse - The animation is played backwards first, then forwards
                animation-timing-function: ease;              (Specifies the speed curve of the animation):
                                        ease - Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
                                        linear - Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end
                                        ease-in - Specifies an animation with a slow start
                                        ease-out - Specifies an animation with a slow end
                                        ease-in-out - Specifies an animation with a slow start and end
                                        cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier function.
                animation-fill-mode: forwards;                  (Used to have the animation styles applied before or after the animation plays.):
                                        normal - the styles will only be applied to the animated element when it’s playing.
                                        forwards- then the animated element will retain its style values defined by the last keyframe.
                                        backwards- the element will take on the style values defined by the first keyframe before it begins playing.
                                        both - the animation’s style values will be applied before and after the animation plays.

                }

                2. Add keyframe rule:
                    @keyframes slide-right {
                        from {margin-left: 0px; background-color:red;}
                        25% {margin-left: 50px; background-color:green;}
                        50% {margin-left: 100px; background-color:yellow;}
                        75% {margin-left: 150px; background-color:pink;}
                        to {margin-left: 200px; background-color:black;}
                    }

                ANIMATION SHORTHAND PROPERTY: This example uses six of the animation properties:
                    div {
                    animation-name: slide-in;
                    animation-duration: 5s;
                    animation-timing-function: linear;
                    animation-delay: 2s;
                    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
                    animation-direction: alternate;
                    }
                    
                SHORTHAND: div {
                            animation: slide-in 5s linear 2s infinite alternate;
                            }

                SLIDE UP ANIMATION: 
                    .slideup{
                        animation: slideUp 5s normal;
                        }

                    @keyframes slideUp{
                        from {
                            transform: translateY(1%);
                            opacity: 0;
                        }
                        to {
                            transform: translateY(0);
                            opacity: 1;
                        }
                    }

                //FLASH ANIMATION: 
                    .challenge .active {
                        animation: flash 1s infinite;
                    }
                @keyframes flash {
                    0% {
                        opacity: 0.5;
                    }
                    50% {
                        opacity: 1;
                    }
                    100% {
                        opacity: 0.5;
                    }
                    }

                Explanation:
                A. from State
                transform: translateY(100%): This means the element is translated (moved) vertically by 100% of its own height. The element is positioned 100% of its height below its normal position. For example, if the element's height is 100px, it will be moved down by 100px.
                        i.e. The element is positioned just below its normal location (moved down by 100% of its height). The element is fully transparent and not visible.
                opacity: 0: The element is fully transparent at the start of the animation.

                B. to State
                transform: translateY(0): This means the element is translated back to its original position (no vertical translation). The element is in its normal vertical position.
                        i.e. The element smoothly moves upward from the translated position to its normal position. The opacity gradually increases from 0 (transparent) to 1 (fully visible). The element reaches its normal position. The element is fully visible.
                opacity: 1: The element is fully opaque (visible) at the end of the animation.
               
                SLIDE UP:  transform: translateY(100%);
                SLIDE DOWN:  transform: translateY(-100%);
                SLIDE LEFT:  transform: translateX(100%);;
                SLIDE RIGHT:  transform: translateX(-100%);;

How can i maintain an animation to happen again each time a section is viewed
    To make an animation occur each time a section is viewed (i.e., scrolled into view), you can use the Intersection Observer API. This API allows you to observe when an element enters or exits the viewport, and you can trigger animations accordingly.
            window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
                const sections = document.querySelectorAll('.section');

                const options = {
                    root: null, // relative to the viewport
                    rootMargin: '0px',
                    threshold: 0.1 // trigger when 10% of the section is visible
                };

                const callback = (entries, observer) => {
                    entries.forEach(entry => {
                        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
                            entry.target.classList.add('section-visible');
                            // Reset animation
                            entry.target.addEventListener('animationend', () => {
                                entry.target.classList.remove('section-visible');
                            }, { once: true });
                        }
                    });
                };

                const observer = new IntersectionObserver(callback, options);

                sections.forEach(section => {
                    observer.observe(section);
                });
            });

            Explanation
            Intersection Observer API:
            Options:
            root: null: The viewport is the root.
            rootMargin: '0px': No margin around the root.
            threshold: 0.1: Trigger the callback when 10% of the section is visible.
            Callback Function:
            Checks if each observed entry (section) is intersecting (i.e., visible in the viewport).
            If intersecting, adds the section-visible class to start the animation.
            Adds an event listener for animationend to remove the section-visible class after the animation completes, ensuring the animation can be triggered again on re-entry.
            Resetting Animation:

            The event listener for animationend ensures that the section-visible class is removed once the animation is complete, allowing the animation to restart when the section is viewed again.
            Customization
            Animation Duration: Adjust the transition properties in the CSS to control the animation duration.
            Intersection Threshold: Adjust the threshold in the JavaScript to control when the animation starts based on how much of the section is visible.
            Animation Effects: Customize the CSS to change the type of animation (e.g., fade in, slide in, etc.).
            This approach ensures that each time a section is scrolled into view, the animation is triggered, and it resets when the section leaves the viewport, allowing the animation to occur again upon re-entry.
